## Electrical Voltage

Electrical voltage is defined as electric potential difference between two points of an electric field.

Using water pipe analogy, we can visualize the voltage as height difference that makes the water flow down.

## Electric Current

### Electric current definition

Electrical current is the flow rate of electric charge in electric field, usually in electrical circuit.


## Electrical resistance

### Resistance definition

That measures how the device or material reduces the electric current flow through it.

## Electric Power

Electric power is the rate of energy consumption in an electrical circuit.

- [Root mean square](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Root_mean_square)

### Real power

Real or true power is the power that is used to do the work on the load.

### Reactive power

Reactive power is the power that is wasted and not used to do work on the load.

### Apparent power

The apparent power is the power that is supplied to the circuit.

## Electric Charge

### What is electric charge?

Electric charge generates electric field. The electric charge influence other electric charges with electric force and influenced by the other charges with the same force in the opposite direction.


### Positive charge (+)

### Negative charge (-)
