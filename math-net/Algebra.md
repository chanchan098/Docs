# Radical

A radical expression, also referred to as an $n^{th}$ root, or simply radical, is an expression that involves a root.

Radicals are expressed using a radicand (similar to a dividend), a radical symbol, and an index, which is typically denoted as "n."

a radical written without an index is assumed to be a square root.

The above figure, as a whole, makes up a radical. It is read as "the $n^{th}$ root of (x + 2)."

Note that radicals and exponents are closely related, and a radical can be written as the radicand raised to the power of $\frac{1}{n}$

$$\sqrt[n]{x}=x^{\frac{1}{n}}$$

## Properties of radicals

$\sqrt[n]{xy}$ = $\sqrt[n]{x}\times\sqrt[n]{y}$

$\sqrt[n]{\frac{x}{y}}$ = $\frac{\sqrt[n]{x}}{\sqrt[n]{y}}$
