$15 \div 3 = 5$ 

multiple  times  
$9 \div 3 = 3$

$\frac{1}{3} + \frac{1}{3}$

$\frac{1}{3} + 2$ = $\frac{1}{3} + \frac{2}{1}$  = $\frac{1}{3} + \frac{6}{3}$


$\frac{1}{3} \times 2$ = $\frac{1}{3} \times \frac{2}{1}$ = $\frac{2}{3}$

$\frac{1}{3} + \frac{1}{9}$ = $\frac{3}{9} + \frac{1}{9}$ = $\frac{4}{9}$
