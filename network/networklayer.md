## What is the OSI model?

The Open Systems Interconnection (OSI) Model is a description of how the Internet works.  
It breaks down the functions involved in sending data over the Internet into seven layers.  
Each layer has some function that prepares the data to be sent over wires, cables, and radio waves as a series of bits.
