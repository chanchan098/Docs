# Formulas

## Difference of Squares

https://www.storyofmathematics.com/difference-of-squares/

$a^2 – b^2 = (a + b) (a – b)$

## Perfect Square Trinomial

https://www.storyofmathematics.com/perfect-square-trinomial/

$(a+b)(a+b)=a^2+2ab+b^2$

$(a-b)(a-b)=a^2-2ab+b^2$

$(a \pm b)(a \pm b)=a^2 \pm 2ab+b^2$

# Division

6 × 4 = 24, so 24 ÷ 4 = 6.

- 24 is the dividend.
- 4 is the divisor.
- 6 is the quotient.


# Number


## Even numbers

An even number is an integer that can be divided by 2 such that there is a remainder of 0.

## Least common multiple

https://www.math.net/lcm

### Euclid's algorithm


1. Divide the larger number by the smaller number. If the remainder is 0, the divisor is the GCF, if not continue to the next step.
2. Divide the smaller number (the previous divisor) by the remainder. If the new remainder is 0, the divisor is the GCF.
3. Continue the process of dividing the previous divisor by the remainder until there is no remainder. The divisor that results in a remainder of 0 is the GCF of the original two numbers.


$$LCM(a,b) = \frac{|a \times b|}{GCF(a,b)}$$

```
    4   6
    
       __1__
     4 | 6 
       | 4

         2  | 4
              4
             ———
              0

    great common factor is 2

```

$GCF(4,6)=2$

$$LCM(4,6)=\frac{4 \times 6}{2}=12$$

# Addition

## Addend

https://www.math.net/addend

An addend (also summand) is any of the numbers that are added to form the sum in an addition problem.  
Together with an operation and equality symbol (in this case addition (+) and equals (=))


## Associative property of addition

The associative property of addition states that how the numbers in an addition problem are grouped doesn't change the sum.

# Multiplication

Multiplication can be explained by using several different situations. Some of these situations are repeated addition, array, area, and combinations.

## How to multiply

### Long multiplication

## Product

### Product of integers

- Positive * Positive = Positive
- Negative * Negative = Positive
- Positive * Negative = Negative
- Negative * Positive = Negative

## Partial products

To check out examples

## C-Inverse

$2 \times5=10 $ => $5=10\div2$; also $5=\frac{10}{2}$  

Another one

$2 \times5=10 $ => $2=10\div5$; also $2=\frac{10}{5}$  

<br/>

Algebra

$2n=b$, so $n=\frac{b}{2}$

# Fraction

## Common fraction

https://www.math.net/common-fraction

## Dividing fractions

We can divide fractions using the following steps:

1. When dividing two fractions, first determine which fraction is the dividend (the number being divided),  
   and which fraction is the divisor (number the dividend is divided by)
2. Switch the positions of the numerator and denominator of the divisor; this is called taking the reciprocal
3. Multiply the numerators of the dividend and the reciprocated divisor
4. Multiply the denominators of the dividend and the reciprocated divisor
5. Simplify the resulting fraction if necessary

**Example**  

$\frac{5}{8} \div \frac{11}{2} = \frac{5}{8} \div \frac{2}{11}=\frac{5\times2}{8\times11}=\frac{10}{88}=\frac{5}{44}$

### Dividing fractions and whole numbers

The whole number needs to be expressed as a fraction.  
To express a whole number as a fraction, all we need to do is write the whole number over 1, since any number divided by 1 is itself.

$\frac{3}{4}\div4=\frac{3}{4}\div\frac{4}{1}=\frac{3}{4}\times\frac{1}{4}=\frac{3}{16}$

## Multiplying fractions

Examples:  
$\frac{2}{5} \times  \frac{4}{7} = \frac{8}{35}$

### Multiplying fractions and whole numbers

To represent a whole number in fraction form, we can simply treat the whole number as the numerator of the fraction while putting a 1 in the denominator.

Examples:  
$12\times\frac{3}{4}=\frac{12}{1}\times\frac{3}{4}=\frac{36}{4}=9$

### Multiplying mixed fractions

requires that we convert the mixed fraction into an improper fraction before multiplying.

Examples:  
$2\frac{3}{4} \times \frac{7}{9}$


<br/>

To convert this into an improper fraction, we multiply the denominator, 4, by 2, and then add the numerator.  
$2\times4+3=11$

$\frac{4}{4}+\frac{4}{4}+\frac{3}{4}$

so $\;2\frac{3}{4}=\frac{11}{4}$

$\frac{11}{4} \times \frac{7}{9} = \frac{77}{36}$


## Reciprocal

The reciprocal of a number is *1 divided by the number*. All numbers have a reciprocal, except for 0, since the reciprocal of 0 is undefined.

The reciprocal of a non-zero integer such as 5 is: $5$ < = > $ \frac{1}{5}$

Notice that if you take the reciprocal of a reciprocal, you get the *original number* (1/5 is the reciprocal of 5 and vice versa). 


$\frac{1}{5} \times 5 = \frac{1}{5} \times \frac{5}{1} = 1$

we can confirm that $\frac{1}{5}$  is the reciprocal of 5. Multiplying any expression by its reciprocal will result in 1.

**Example**  

$\frac{12}{7} $; reciprocal is $\frac{7}{12}$

1.25; reciprocal is $\frac{1}{1.25}=0.8$, cause $1.25 \times 0.8=1$

<br/>

We also could have converted 1.25 to an improper fraction, then flipped the improper fraction:

$1.25=\frac{5}{4}$  

$1.25=\frac{1.25}{1}=\frac{125}{100}=\frac{25}{20}=\frac{5}{4}$


The reciprocal is therefore $\frac{4}{5}$, which is equal to 0.8.


# Percentage

https://www.math.net/percentage

## Percentages as decimals and fractions

### As a fraction

10% = $\frac{10}{100}$ = $\frac{1}{10}$

36% = $\frac{36}{100}$ = $\frac{9}{25}$

83% = $\frac{83}{100}$

### As a decimal

To express a percent as a decimal, move the decimal point *two places to the left*.

This works because, in the decimal numeral system, each place represents the subsequent power of 10.  
Moving a decimal point right is the equivalent of multiplying by 10, and moving a decimal point left is the equivalent of dividing by 10. 

Since a percentage can be represented as a fraction out of 100,  
any percentage can be converted to a decimal by dividing by 100 (or shifting the decimal point two places to the left).

10% = 0.01  
36% = 0.36  
83% = 0.83

## Percentages in everyday life

### Sales tax

Sales tax is a tax on certain goods and services.  
For example, given a sales tax of 8.25%, you would have to pay *an additional 8.25%* of the price of the goods you purchase.


**Example**  
If there is a sales tax of 8.25%, what is the total amount you will pay for goods that cost $12?

Multiplying either the fraction or decimal by 12 tells us what 8.25% of 12 is:

0.0825 × 12 = 0.99

This means that you would have to pay an additional 99 cents on top of the \$12, for a total of \$12.99.  
<u>We also could've multiplied 12 by 1.0825 to get the same result.</u>

### Discounts

Understanding percentages allows us to calculate how much we will save when purchasing discounted things.

**Example**  
A shirt originally priced at $15 is discounted 20%. How much money will you save?

20% of $15 can be calculated by multiplying 15 by 0.20 or 20/100.

$\frac{20}{100} \times 15 = \frac{20}{100} \times \frac{15}{1} = \frac{300}{100} = 3$

Therefore, a 20% discount results in $3 of savings.

## Percent change

https://www.math.net/percent-change

Percent change is the amount that a quantity changes relative to its original value.

$\%change=\frac{(new\;-\;old)}{|old|} \times 100\%$

Old here refers to the value we start with, or the initial value, while new refers to the final value.

When we subtract the old from the new value, we can get a negative number, a positive number, or 0.   
A positive number would mean that the initial value increased.  
A negative number means that the initial value decreased.  
In order to get a 0 difference, the old and new number would have to be the same, meaning there was no change.

**Examples**

Given an initial value of 5, how much of a percentage increase will result in a new value of 12?

$\frac{12\;-\;5}{|5|}=1.4 \times 100\% = 140\%$

So, 12 is a 140% increase of 5.

## Percent to decimal

Converting a percent to a decimal involves simply shifting the decimal place by dividing the percent by 100.

**Example**  
Say we want to convert 8.25% to a decimal. We need to shift the decimal place two spaces to the left:

![alt](https://www.math.net/img/a/primary-math/percentage/percent-to-decimal/ptd.svg)

So, 8.25% in decimal form is 0.0825.


# Data and graphs

## Range

### Range (interval) in mathematics

The term range is commonly used in mathematics to refer to an interval.  
An interval in this context is the set of real numbers that lie between two numbers.


**Examples**  
If we say that the range is some set of numbers, n, between and including 0 and 100, this means that our range is 0, 100, and all of the numbers between 0 and 100. This is written as:

$$0 \leq n \leq 100$$

This is referred to as a *closed interval*, because it does include the endpoints.  
It can also be written as [0, 100].

<br/><br/>

If instead we were to write:

$$0 < n < 100$$

The range would be all the numbers between 0 and 100, but not including 0 and 100.  
This is referred to as an *open interval* because it doesn't include the endpoints.  
It can also be written as (0, 100).

We could also have a range of (0, 100] or 0 < n ≤ 100 and [0, 100) or 0 ≤ n < 100.


# Rules and properties

## Basic mathematical properties

### Order of operations

PEMDAS: Parentheses, exponents, multiplication, division, addition, subtraction

BODMAS: Brackets, order, division, multiplication, addition, subtraction

Notice that multiplication and division are in different positions in PE(MD)AS and BO(DM)AS; this is because multiplication and division, and addition and subtraction, can be performed in either order

### Distributive property

The distributive property states that multiplying a group of numbers that are being added is the same as multiplying by each number individually, then adding them together.

$a × (b + c) = a × b + a × c$

## Inverse

### Addition and subtraction

Addition and subtraction are inverses in that the sign is reversed between operations.

**Example**   
$4 + 3	=	7$  
$7 - 3	=	4$  
As can be seen, adding 3 to 4 and then subtracting 3 from the sum leaves us where we started, with 4. 

### Multiplication and division

The inverse operation of multiplication is division, where in either case, reciprocating results in the other operation.

**Example**  

$6 × 5	=	30$  
$30 ÷ 5	=	6$

As shown above, multiplication and division essentially cancel each other out, which is why they are inverse operations

# Ratios and proportions

A ratio is a comparison between quantities. 

A proportion is a set of ratios that are equal.


## Ratios


## Proportions

Proportions are equations made up of two equivalent ratios. The following are all proportions:

$2:3=6:9$  
$\frac{2}{3}=\frac{6}{9}$

A ratio of 2:3 is said to be proportional to a ratio of 4:6 (or 6:9, 8:12, etc.). Proportions indicate that the relative sizes of the objects being compared are the same. 


**Example**

If the ratio of apples to students is proportional, and there are 2 apples for every 1 student, how many apples are there in a class of 30 students?

This problem can be set up as a proportion.  
The ratio of apples to students is 2:1. The total number of students is known.  
To find the number of apples, write the ratios in fraction form and *cross multiply*:

$\frac{2\;apples}{1\;student}=\frac{\#\;apples}{30\;students}$

$2 × 30 = 1 × \#$

$\# = 60$
