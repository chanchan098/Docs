### Joule

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joule

One joule is equal to the amount of work done when a force of one newton displaces a body through a distance of one metre in the direction of that force. 

$1J = 1 kg â‹… m^2 / s^2$


### Farad

Farad is the unit of capacitance. It represents the amount of electric charge in coulombs that is stored per 1 volt.

$1F = 1C / 1V$

### Hertz (Hz)

Hertz is the unit of frequency. It measures the number of cycles per second.

$1 Hz = 1 cycles / s$


### Henry (H)

Henry is the unit of inductance.

$1H = 1Wb / 1A$

## Supplement

### Work

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Work_(physics)

work is the energy transferred to or from an object via the application of force along a displacement.
