<span style='font-size: 16px;font-weight: 500'>What are imperative verbs</span>  

The imperative verb is an action a speaker or writer wants someone else to do. 

# Imperative sentences

https://www.grammarly.com/blog/imperative-sentences/



What is an imperative sentence?
When you make a request, offer advice, issue a command, or give an instruction, you use the imperative mood. 

# Determiners

<span style='font-size: 16px;font-weight: 500'>What is a determiner?</span>  

A determiner, also known as a limiting adjective, is a word that appears before a noun, providing clarifying context about the number, definiteness, or ownership of the noun.

# Articles

## A or an?
Use a before consonant sounds: a chair, a horse, a laptop

This includes letters u or eu when they are pronounced y (/j/): a university, a euro

Use an before vowel sounds. These words usually start with a, e, i, o, u: an architect, an idea, an umbrella

Also use an with words that start with the letter h when the h is not pronounced: an hour, an honour

## Take note: school/university, etc.

There is a special rule for these places: school, university, college, hospital, prison, church. Compare these examples:

The children go to school by bus.             I go to the school to help twice a week.

Ben's studying maths at university.       He works in the canteen at the university.

She was in hospital for three weeks.       Is there a shop in the hospital? 

If someone is at the place because they are a student / are sick / a prisoner, etc, we don't use the. If they are there for another reason, or we are talking about the building, we use the.

# Question forms

https://www.bbc.co.uk/learningenglish/english/course/lower-intermediate/unit-1/tab/grammar

## Meaning and Use

<span style='font-size: 16px;font-weight: 500'>Yes/no questions</span>  

often begin with the verb <u>to be</u>, but can also begin with <u>other auxiliary verbs</u>, such as do.  
We ask these when we want a yes or no answer.


<span style='font-size: 16px;font-weight: 500'>Wh-questions</span>  

start with <u>a question word</u>, such as <u>who, what, where, when, why or how.</u>  
We ask this type of question when we want different kinds of information.  
These questions cannot be answered with a yes or no.


## Asking questions with ‘how’

The question word how is usually combined with other words when asking for information, such as size, someone’s age, or the price of something.

# Comparatives and Superlatives

# State verbs and action verbs

https://www.bbc.co.uk/learningenglish/english/course/lower-intermediate/unit-25/tab/grammar

## meaning and use

<u>Action verbs</u> describe things we do or things that happen. 

- Ted is playing football.
- The sun rose at six this morning.

We use <u>state verbs</u> to talk about attitudes, thoughts, senses or belonging. Sometimes, state verbs can also describe actions. Most state verbs are not used in the continuous (-ing) form.

- The children love ice cream.
- I believe in angels.

# Quantifiers: all, every, each, both, neither, either

https://www.bbc.co.uk/learningenglish/english/course/intermediate/unit-3/tab/grammar

## Meaning and use: all, every each

Quantifiers are words that give us information about the number or amount of something.

All, every and each mean the whole number of something in a group, but there are differences in how we use them. 

<u>All</u> or <u>All the</u> is followed by a plural or uncountable noun. <u>Every</u> and <u>each</u> are followed by a singular noun.

## Meaning and use of both, neither, either

We use both (of), neither (of) and either (of) to talk about two people or things.

Both means this one AND the other.  
Neither means NOT this one AND NOT the other.  
Either means this one OR the other.

# Subject-object questions

https://www.bbc.co.uk/learningenglish/english/course/lower-intermediate/unit-18/tab/grammar

## Meaning and use

A simple way of asking questions in English is by using <u>interrogatives, or question words, such as who or what.</u> These questions are called wh-questions and are used when asking for information. 

- What time is it?
- Who ate the biscuits?

Look at this sentence:

- Sally met David Beckham.

We can ask about the subject or object of this sentence:

- Asking about the subject: Who met David Beckham? Sally met David Beckham.

- Asking about the object: Who did Sally meet? Sally met David Beckham.

The first question is a subject question because who refers to the subject. There is no auxiliary. The second question is an object question because who refers to the object and comes before the auxiliary did.

# 'Used to' and 'would'

https://www.bbc.co.uk/learningenglish/english/course/lower-intermediate/unit-29/tab/grammar

### Meaning and use

We can use <u>used to</u> and <u>would</u> to talk about things we did regularly in the past, but we don’t do now.  

We use used to for either habits or states in the past.  
Would is used only for past habits, not for past states.

### Used to - Habit

- Isabel used to sing in a band.
- Pablo didn’t use to drive to work.
- Did John use to study with you?

### Used to - State

- Bob used to be much shorter.
- I didn’t use to like art.
- Did Wayne use to belong to the debate team?
- Didn’t Margaret use to hate flying?

### Would - Habit (not for states)

- Since I always had that day free, I would shop for groceries every Monday.
- Since we were always in a hurry, we wouldn’t stop for tea on Fridays.
- Would you often stay for lunch?

| PERFECT <BR/> CONTINUOUTS |

### Past tenses

<span style='font-size: 16px;font-weight: 500'>Simple past</span>  

We use the simple past to show actions completed in the past, with no extra emphasis. 


<span style='font-size: 16px;font-weight: 500'>Past perfect</span>  

shows that one past action happened <u>earlier than</u> another one. 

- She had arrived at the office before she realized it was Sunday. 


<span style='font-size: 16px;font-weight: 500'>Past continuous</span>  

to show an <u>ongoing action</u> in the past, especially if the action <u>was interrupted</u> by another action.  
It’s also used for habitual actions that occurred in the past but not in the present.


<span style='font-size: 16px;font-weight: 500'>Past perfect continuous</span>  

used just like the past perfect tense, except it describes ongoing actions that happened in the past instead of a one-time occurence.  
It’s often used with the words when, until, and before <u>to connect it to another past action.</u>  

Before he got his first job as a writer, he had been working as a proofreader. 

I had been living on my friend’s couch for a year until they kicked me out. 


### Present tenses 

<span style='font-size: 16px;font-weight: 500'>Simple present</span>  


<span style='font-size: 16px;font-weight: 500'>Present perfect</span>

https://topenglishgrammar.com/future-in-the-past/

<span style='font-size: 16px;font-weight: 500'>How to use it?</span>  
We use the Future in the Past to shape the future of the past. To show <u>the future from the perspective of the past</u>.

# Conditionals

[zero & first](http://www.bbc.co.uk/learningenglish/english/course/intermediate/unit-5/tab/grammar)

## Zero conditional

We use the zero conditional to talk about things which <u>always happen</u> if a particular action takes place. These can be scientific facts, or things we believe are always true.

- When you take exercise, your heart beats faster.
- If I drink milk, I get stomach ache.

We can use if or when with the same meaning:  
- If you take exercise, your heart beats faster.
- When I drink milk, I get stomach ache.

## First conditional

We use the first conditional to talk about things which <u>might happen</u> if an action takes place.  
We use if for things which are likely to happen and when for things which are certain to happen.

- If I see Freddy later, I’ll give him the book. (I’m not certain I’ll see him.)
- When I see Freddy later, I’ll give him the book. (I’m certain I’ll see him.)
 
- If we go to the beach, I’ll take my swimsuit. (It isn’t certain we’ll go to the beach.)
- When we go to the beach, I’ll take my swimsuit. (It is certain we’ll go to the beach.)

## Second conditional

We use the second conditional in English when we want to talk about <u>unreal situations</u> or things we don’t think will happen.  
We use it to talk about the <u>possible results</u> of these situations. It is made like this:

A conditional sentence has two parts. The if part tells us about the unreal or unlikely situation.  
The would part tells us the possible results of this situation.

<u>if + past simple, … would + infinitive</u>

examples:  
- If we all recycled more, there would be a lot less waste in the world.
- If I lived by the sea, I’d go swimming every day.
- If I had more free time, I would be more relaxed.
- I would be more relaxed if I had more free time.

A conditional sentence has two parts. The `if` part tells us about the unreal or unlikely situation.  
The `would` part tells us the possible results of this situation.


We use the past simple in the `if` part – but second conditional sentences aren’t about the past.  
We use the past form to show that the situation isn’t real. The `would` part tells us the result of this imaginary situation.

## Third conditional

We use the third conditional to talk about <u>imagined past events</u>: things that might have happened in the past, but didn’t happen.

examples:  
- If I’d known it was your birthday, I’d have bought you a present.
- If the taxi had arrived on time, he wouldn’t have missed the plane.



the `if` part is the imaginary situation in the past, and the `main` part is what could have happened (but didn’t happen) as a result.  
We make the third conditional with <u>if + past perfect</u>, and <u>would have + past participle</u>.

We use the past perfect in the `if` part to show the situation is imaginary and didn’t actually happen.  
The `main` part of the sentence tells us the imaginary result of this situation.

- If there had been any snow, we’d have gone skiing. (There wasn’t any snow; we didn’t go skiing.)
- If it hadn’t been raining, we’d have had a picnic.(It was raining; we didn’t have a picnic.)
