## Calculus

### Limits

A limit is the value that a function approaches as its input value approaches some value.

It provides information about <u>a function's behavior near a point, rather than at that point.</u>

### Continuity

Informally, a function is said to be continuous if its graph is a single unbroken curve;

Formally, a function $f(x)$ is continuous at some point $x = a$ if:  

- $f(a)$ is defined
- $\lim_ {x \to a} f(x)$ exists
- $f(a) = \lim_ {x \to a} f(x)$

### Derivatives

In general terms, the derivative of a function is a measure of how rapidly a function's output changes relative to a change in the input value.

$$\lim_ {x \to a} f(x)=L$$
