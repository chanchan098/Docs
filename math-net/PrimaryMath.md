# Division

6 × 4 = 24, so 24 ÷ 4 = 6.

- 24 is the dividend.
- 4 is the divisor.
- 6 is the quotient.


# Number


## Even numbers

An even number is an integer that can be divided by 2 such that there is a remainder of 0.

## Least common multiple

### Euclid's algorithm


1. Divide the larger number by the smaller number. If the remainder is 0, the divisor is the GCF, if not continue to the next step.
2. Divide the smaller number (the previous divisor) by the remainder. If the new remainder is 0, the divisor is the GCF.
3. Continue the process of dividing the previous divisor by the remainder until there is no remainder. The divisor that results in a remainder of 0 is the GCF of the original two numbers.


$$LCM(a,b) = \frac{|a \times b|}{GCF(a,b)}$$

```
    4   6
    
       __1__
     4 | 6 
       | 4
        ——— __2__
         2  | 4
              4
             ———
              0

    great common factor is 2

```

$GCF(4,6)=2$

$$LCM(4,6)=\frac{4 \times 6}{2}=12$$

# Addition

## Addend

https://www.math.net/addend

An addend (also summand) is any of the numbers that are added to form the sum in an addition problem.  
Together with an operation and equality symbol (in this case addition (+) and equals (=))


## Associative property of addition

The associative property of addition states that how the numbers in an addition problem are grouped doesn't change the sum.

# Multiplication

Multiplication can be explained by using several different situations. Some of these situations are repeated addition, array, area, and combinations.

## How to multiply

### Long multiplication

## Product

### Product of integers

- Positive * Positive = Positive
- Negative * Negative = Positive
- Positive * Negative = Negative
- Negative * Positive = Negative

## Partial products

# Fraction

## Common fraction

# Percentage

## Percentages as decimals and fractions

### As a fraction

10% = $\frac{10}{100}$ = $\frac{1}{10}$

36% = $\frac{36}{100}$ = $\frac{9}{25}$

83% = $\frac{83}{100}$

### As a decimal

To express a percent as a decimal, move the decimal point *two places to the left*.

This works because, in the decimal numeral system, each place represents the subsequent power of 10.  
Moving a decimal point right is the equivalent of multiplying by 10, and moving a decimal point left is the equivalent of dividing by 10. 

Since a percentage can be represented as a fraction out of 100,  
any percentage can be converted to a decimal by dividing by 100 (or shifting the decimal point two places to the left).

10% = 0.01  
36% = 0.36  
83% = 0.83

## Percentages in everyday life

### Sales tax

Sales tax is a tax on certain goods and services.  
For example, given a sales tax of 8.25%, you would have to pay *an additional 8.25%* of the price of the goods you purchase.


**Example**  
If there is a sales tax of 8.25%, what is the total amount you will pay for goods that cost $12?

Multiplying either the fraction or decimal by 12 tells us what 8.25% of 12 is:

0.0825 × 12 = 0.99

This means that you would have to pay an additional 99 cents on top of the \$12, for a total of \$12.99.  
<u>We also could've multiplied 12 by 1.0825 to get the same result.</u>
